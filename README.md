# ctf_writeups

My TryHackMe & CTF writeups — tools, notes and lessons learned.

## Structure
- `thm/` — TryHackMe rooms 
- `htb/` — Hack The Box 
- `tools/` — small scripts or useful snippets

## About
I solve labs to practice web, linux, and privilege escalation. Proofs are screenshots or hashed flags (no raw flags).

## How to read
Open a folder inside `thm/` and view the `README.md` for each room.
